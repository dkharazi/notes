I live in Columbus, Ohio and work on a data science team at Abercrombie.

Before Abercrombie, I worked as a consultant while studying statistics and computer science at Ohio State University (Class of 2018). During college and high school, I made iOS apps and got involved in [programming competitions](https://data-analytics.osu.edu/datafest/previous-datafests-2018). I started programming in JavaScript and Java when I was 14, but now I usually write code in Python. Most of my experience in the last few years has been machine learning, data engineering, and backend development. I occasionally [write code](https://github.com/dkharazi) for fun in my spare time.

What about stuff outside of technology?

- My two passions in life are soccer and Indian food
- On top of that, I enjoy skiing when I get the chance
- I usually listen to either soft rock, indie pop, or lo-fi hip hop
- I've done a triathlon and a few bike tours
- I'm halfway through visiting all 50 U.S. states
- I played the piano actively for 10+ years
- I want to stop eating meat one day
- My favorite tv show is The Office
